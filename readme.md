Theorem 3.1.4
If A is a square triangular matrix, then det A is the product of the entries on the main diagonal.
Theorem 3.1.4 is useful in computer calculations because it is a routine matter to carry a matrix to trian-
gular form using row operations.
Block matrices such as those in the next theorem arise frequently in practice, and the theorem gives an
easy method for computing their determinants. This dovetails with Example 2.4.11.
